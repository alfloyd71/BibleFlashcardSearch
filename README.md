# Bible Flashcards Search

Bible Flashcard Search is an open source flashcards app that lets you search for any verse in the King James Version(KJV) of the Bible by verse number and then create a flashcard to be added to a flashcards list.  BFS uses the "flashcard box system" that organizes and uses flashcards in a systematic way to enhance learning through spaced repetition.
Besides the Django package, pythonbible is the only other dependency all other files are included in the bibleflashcardsjs folder.  

Box Levels: Each box represents a different level of familiarity or mastery:

<ul><li>Box 1 (New Material): This box contains new flashcards or cards that the learner is less familiar with.</li>
<li>Box 2 (Review): Flashcards that have been successfully recalled a few times are moved to this box for regular review.</li>
<li>Box 3 (Mastery): Cards from Box 2 that have been consistently recalled correctly are promoted to this box for less frequent review.</li>
<li>Optional Boxes: Some systems may include additional boxes for more advanced levels of mastery, such as Box 4 and Box 5.</li>
</ul>
